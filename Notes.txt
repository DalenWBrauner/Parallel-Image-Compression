I realized it's important I scrap this plan and just jump into PyCUDA.
I had forgotten the reason I had shifted away from Python Threading was because of its awful near-900 thread limit. I simply can't create as many threads as I need to. If PyCUDA has this limitation, fine, but I'm quite confident it's designed not to.
Which means I'd have to craft a completely different solution to have the compressor work in threaded Python rather than PyCUDA, which is a huge waste of my time.
So today I accomplished little. I should be ashamed of it, but at least I'm moving forward.
I don't mind my thoughts being public. I'm growing, and always will be.
