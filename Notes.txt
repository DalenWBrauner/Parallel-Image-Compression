Image Prereqs:
	Images must have dimensions that are multiples of 8
	No single dimension can exceed 2040 pixels
	Images ought to be in .png format

Compression.py:
	Currently:
		A python file that will compress a user-specified image. Aside from libraries, contains all functions required to do so sans arraymap.
	Future:
		A python library consisting of all functions required to compress an image.

Compression_Threaded.py:
	Currently:
		A highly unfinished python file originally destined to be able to compress images via threads.
	Future:
		A python file that will compress a user-specified image via threading.
		...Or maybe it'll be obsolete and I'll incorporate that functionality into something else.

Compression_GPU.py
	Currently:
		A highly unfinished python file originally destined to be able to compress images via PyCUDA threads.
	Future:
		A python file that will compress a user-specified image via PyCUDA threading.
		...Or maybe it'll be obsolete and I'll incorporate that functionality into something else.

Decompression.py:
	Currently:
		A python file that will decompress a user-specified ".compressed" file. Aside from libraries, contains all functions required to do so sans arraymap.
	Future:
		A python library consisting of all functions required to decompress output from Compression.py.

Debug.py
	Currently:
		A python library consisting of many of the functions required to debug Compression.py and Decompression.py.
	Future:
		A python library consisting of many of the functions required to debug all included python files.

Resaver.py
	Currently:
		A python file that will compress and immediately decompress an image file. (Was mostly used for debugging.)
	Future:
		Obsolete. Debugging potential may be integrated into Debug.py. 

Run_Me.py:
	Currently:
		In-progress. Doesn't do much of anything.
	Future:
		What a user will run when they want to do anything sans debugging.
